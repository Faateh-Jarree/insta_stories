# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo.
# Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the screenshots whenever they are needed.

# Code Injection
#
# After adding a build phase to inject code (e.g. for crash reporting), the compiled version of the code will be
# stored in DerivedData and the symbol map will be stored in the same location. This can cause issues with
# source control. You should exclude the following files from source control:

# DerivedData/
# *.moved-aside
# *.pbxuser
# *.mode1v3
# *.mode2v3
# *.perspectivev3
# *.hmap
# *.ipa
# *.xcuserstate
