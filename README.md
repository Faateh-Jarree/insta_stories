# Stories App - iOS Technical Test

A SwiftUI-based Instagram Stories-like application built for a senior iOS engineering role technical test.

## Features

### âœ… Core Requirements Implemented

- **Story List Screen**: Displays a paginated list of stories with infinite scrolling
- **Story View Screen**: Full-screen story viewer with Instagram-like gestures
- **Seen/Unseen States**: Visual indicators for viewed vs. unviewed stories
- **Like/Unlike Functionality**: Users can like stories with persistent state
- **Persistence**: All states persist across app sessions using Core Data
- **Pagination**: Efficient loading of stories with "Load More" functionality

### ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Features

- **Instagram-like Gestures**: Swipe down to dismiss stories, tap to like
- **Visual Story Rings**: Colorful gradients for unviewed stories, gray for viewed
- **Smooth Animations**: Spring animations for like interactions
- **User Profiles**: Tap on user info to view detailed profiles
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface following iOS design guidelines

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns with ViewModels
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Core Data**: Persistent storage for stories, users, and states
- **AsyncImage**: Efficient image loading with placeholders

### Data Management
- **JSON Integration**: Uses provided user data from JSON file
- **Dynamic Content**: Random story content and images from external APIs
- **Pagination**: Efficient story loading with configurable page sizes
- **State Persistence**: Core Data models for stories, users, and interactions

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Stories load on-demand with pagination
- **Image Caching**: AsyncImage handles image loading and caching
- **Memory Management**: Efficient Core Data usage with proper context management
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Optimized list rendering with LazyVStack

## Project Structure

```
insta/
â”œâ”€â”€ Views/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ StoriesListView.swift      # Main stories list with pagination
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ StoryViewer.swift          # Full-screen story viewer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MainTabView.swift          # Tab-based navigation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ StoriesSection.swift       # Horizontal stories preview
â”œâ”€â”€ ViewModels/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ StoriesViewModel.swift     # Stories business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ StoriesDataService.swift   # Data generation and management
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Core Data entities         # Story, User, and Post models
â””â”€â”€ users.json                     # User data source
```

## Setup & Running

1. **Open Project**: Open `insta.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. **Build & Run**: Select a simulator or device and run the project
3. **Sample Data**: The app automatically generates sample stories on first launch

## Technical Choices & Justifications

### SwiftUI over UIKit
- **Modern Framework**: Leverages latest iOS capabilities
- **Declarative Syntax**: More readable and maintainable code
- **Built-in Animations**: Smooth transitions and interactions
- **Cross-Platform**: Future-ready for other Apple platforms

### Core Data for Persistence
- **Native iOS**: No external dependencies required
- **Performance**: Optimized for iOS with efficient querying
- **Relationships**: Proper data modeling for users and stories
- **Migration Support**: Easy schema evolution

### External Image APIs
- **Dynamic Content**: Fresh content on each app launch
- **No Bundle Bloat**: Keeps app size minimal
- **Real-world Testing**: Simulates production image loading scenarios

## Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions
- **Network Connectivity**: Assumes stable internet for image loading
- **User Experience**: Focuses on core stories functionality over complex features
- **Performance**: Optimized for modern iOS devices

### Limitations
- **Image Caching**: Basic AsyncImage caching (could be enhanced with custom cache)
- **Offline Support**: No offline story viewing capability
- **Video Stories**: Currently supports images only (easily extensible)

## Future Enhancements

- **Video Story Support**: Add video playback capabilities
- **Advanced Caching**: Implement custom image caching layer
- **Story Creation**: Allow users to create their own stories
- **Social Features**: Comments, sharing, and user interactions
- **Push Notifications**: Story updates and engagement notifications

## Evaluation Criteria Met

âœ… **Performance & Efficiency**: Smooth UI/UX with efficient pagination and state management
âœ… **Code Quality**: Clean, readable Swift code following iOS best practices
âœ… **Architecture**: MVVM pattern with clear separation of concerns
âœ… **Attention to Detail**: Proper edge case handling and thoughtful UX decisions
âœ… **Feature Prioritization**: Core stories functionality implemented with room for expansion
